# Multi-Agent GPT

Multi-Agent GPT is a collaborative project that uses GPT models to generate text-based dialogues between multiple agents as they work towards predefined goals. The project is aimed at exploring the capabilities of GPT models for multi-agent productivity and communication.

## How it works
